# MaMD Analytical

*MaMD Analytical* uses an artificial neural network (aNN) to classify an unknown cranium into a reference group. The reference data are housed in the Macromorphoscopic Databank, established in 2018 by Hefner (2018).

# Grant Funding

National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Award # 2015-DN-BX-K012: A Macromorphoscopic Databank: Establishing the Statistical Analysis of Macromorphoscopic Data in Forensic Anthropology. PI: JT Hefner

## State of Application -- Beta version 0.3.15 (January 2020)

The current version of *MaMD Analytical* (v0.3.15) is not the final application for public release. This version is available for download and, while the in-house alpha testing of the program has been successful, beta testing by external groups for validation may identify heretofore unknown issues in design or analysis. The research team welcomes beta testing via GitHub, to provide answers to technicalities that may arise following the public release of *MaMD Analytical*; and, just as importantly, beta testing will also deliver insight into the features that should be added or avoided prior to and following public release. *MaMD Analytical* should not be used for forensic casework or for validation research at this time without discussions with Dr. Joseph Hefner. The research team requests any feedback noted during beta testing of the *MaMD Analytical Tool*.
